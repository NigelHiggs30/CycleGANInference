# Autonomous AI-Training for Robot-Assisted Sorting for Efficient Recycling

This project focuses on enhancing the efficiency of recycling processes through the use of advanced AI techniques. Specifically, it implements a CycleGAN model to improve the realism of 3D to 2D model transformations, aiding in the sorting of recyclable materials, such as milk jugs.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an autonomous AI system that trains robots to assist in sorting recyclable materials more effectively. By using a CycleGAN model, we aim to create more realistic 2D representations of 3D models, facilitating better recognition and sorting accuracy.

### Features
- **CycleGAN Model**: Utilizes a CycleGAN to transform 3D models into more realistic 2D images.
- **AI-Driven Sorting**: Trains robots to sort recyclable materials with higher precision.
- **Efficiency Improvement**: Aims to streamline recycling processes, reducing waste and improving material recovery rates.
